    "```{admonition} Sample Space\n",
    "The sample space is the possible outcomes of the experiment. For the coin toss experiment, we can denote the sample space as: $\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us say that if the coin lands as Heads, we win 1\\$ and we win 0\\$ if the coin lands as Tails. We can associate a function $W$ with the experiment such that W(Heads) = 1 and W(Tails) = 0\n",

    "```{admonition} Random Variable\n",
    "A random variable is a function mapping the sample space (for example: $\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}$) of an experiment to a measurement space $E = \\{0, 1\\}$. Random variables are represented using capital letters.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While we may have generally seen a random variable W associated with a coin toss taking the values 1 for Heads, 0 for Tails, we might have chosen any other values and still have a random variable. As an example\n",

    "```{admonition} Discrete Random Variable\n",
    "A discrete random variable can take discrete values. For example, W representing the money we win if we toss a coin randomly. Or, Y the top face of a dice when the dice is rolled. \n",
